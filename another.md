# The Future Status of English as the Global Language is Assured

As we know, English replaced Spanish as the world language after the defeat of the Spanish-Dutch War, and remains to this day.  Some people believe that the global language varied by time, and the status of English will change soon. While I think The future status of English as the global language is assured, for its wide usage, adaptable script mode, and irreplaceability in academic realm.

Many people speak English. Global language, sometimes called world language, is a language that is geographically widespread and make it possible for members all around the world to communicate. The mission of the global language doomed that it must have a solid ground for common use. Thus, constructed languages don’t have the foundation to be global language. Esperanto, a constructed language designed for worldwide use, end up become a language that limited in the region of north Europe. In China, most people even haven’t heard it. But English, 59 countries and 27 non-sovereign entities serve it as official language, people heard it worldwide.

Latin script adapts to most languages. Most languages, such as Spanish, Russian, Francai, have similar alphabet with English. Some languages, such as the language that most people use, Chinese, serve verified Latin letters as a tool to standardize pronunciations. But it rarely language use Chinese or other languages as phonetic symbol. Moreover, countless languages have Latinized in the century due to the colonization of English, French or Spanish, such as Vietnamese, Khmir, Laos. Reasons above assured the solid future status of English as the global language.

English have already been global language among intellectual. English is the official language of most academic realms after World War II, such as mathematics, logics, physics, etc. also, most programmers worldwide understand English, otherwise, it become incredibly hard to code or exchange opinions with more skilled programmers.

Above all, I give the result that the future status of English as the global language is assured.
